  "course_description":"Ever hang your head in shame after your Python program wasn't as fast as your friend's C program? Ever wish you could use objects without having to use Java? Join us for this fun introduction to C and C++! We will take you through a tour that will start with writing simple C programs, go deep into the caves of C memory manipulation, resurface with an introduction to using C++ classes, dive deeper into advanced C++ class use and the C++ Standard Template Libraries. We'll wrap up by teaching you some tricks of the trade that you may need for tech interviews.\n\nWe see this as a \"C/C++ empowerment\" course: we want you to come away understanding\n\n1.  why you would want to use C over another language (control over memory, probably for performance reasons),\n2.  why you would want to use C++ rather than C (objects), and\n3.  how to be useful in C and C++.\n\nThis course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.\n",
