Ever wish you could use objects without having to use Java? Join us for this fun introduction to C and C++! We will take you through a tour that will start with writing simple C programs, go deep into the caves of C memory manipulation, resurface with an introduction to using C++ classes, dive deeper into advanced C++ class use and the C++ Standard Template Libraries. We\u0026rsquo;ll wrap up by teaching you some tricks of the trade that you may need for tech interviews.\nWe see this as a \u0026ldquo;C/C++ empowerment\u0026rdquo; course: we want you to come away understanding\nwhy you would want to use C over another language (control over memory, probably for performance reasons), why you would want to use C++ rather than C (objects), and how to be useful in C and C++. Prerequisites We target this course to those with some degree of comfort programming (in Python, Scheme, Java, etc.) who want to become comfortable with using C/C++. No C/C++ experience expected.\nCourse Outline SESÂ # TOPICS 1 Motivation for using C/C++; discussion of where C and C++ sit in the abstraction hierarchy; writing our first C programs 2 The logistics of memory manipulation in C (pointers, structs) 3 More advanced memory manipulation in C. We\u0026rsquo;ll show double linked-list insert in place, inserting into a linked list using a double pointer, corner cases of using memory (when we actually need heap allocation), etc. 4 Introduction to C++; encapsulation: classes, namespaces, constructors and destructors; memory management in C++ (new, delete); operator overloading and standard input/output 5 Inheritance and polymorphism; templates; standard library containers 6 Tricks of the trade. Things people might see in interviews, etc. Review and discussion of the covered topics, Q\u0026amp;A. "}
